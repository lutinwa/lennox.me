            <p>
              I'm Lennox Lutinwa, an economist and and freelance technologist. I graduated from University of Dar es salaam in 2019 with a degree in economics and statistics. I currently do my own personal projects and volunteer work in several places. I have worked at <b>NSSF</b> for a shy two months, there I worked as a registration officer, I mostly did paperwork and issuing cards to members and other clerk duties. I got a chance to work on a different department, compliance we were tasked to go different areas and follow up if people were members of the fund and we would enroll them if they weren't. 
            </p>
            <p>
              I also had a chance to work at Burhani linkage and liasons, there I worked as an intern in the research team of the company. We were tasked with doing research and drawing conclusions on several business plans that needed a backing of data in order to be executed. We worked with companies such as simba logistics and several hospitals to asses competition and draw plans to level competition.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a hobby i took a programming class <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/">cs50</a> and through it learnt to program. The lessons were project-wise learning and in the end we were able to showcase what we learnt througn a end of course project i managed to pull of web application for listing ads and scored my <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SCrvwbsf9MzxQux9W8kYtaNk3oGKuJnv/view?usp=sharing">certificate</a> of completion of the course
              i may add this has been a tremendous achievement and I'm continuing to pursuit further learning more robust frameworks such as django and the whole process of scaling an application on web. This journey has also seen me taking another <em>opencourseware</em> on AI. I hope to use this knowledge to teach also, because i wish everyone can know how to program because not only is it a skill but a new way of thinking and problem solving that involves building software.
            </p>
